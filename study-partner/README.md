As a user a student can find different cohort start dates as well as lectures by phase, or Instructors. The home page is images from NASA that are not filly completed. There are useful features of this application detailed below, but it's main purpose is as a demonstration of React component architecture, client-side routing, fetch calls, and local json database manipulation. This application is a labor of love created for a React group project by Joshua Collins, Jai Stellmacher, and Layne Andrews all software engineering students at Flatiron School.
